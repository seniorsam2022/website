            <p>Why "Supérate Forever"? It assigned this name to show that 
                Supérate will be forever; it will always be there to help us. 
                It was created on November 1, 2022, to help Supérate students 
                with their questions about the subjects taught in the classes, 
                such as English, Computer Science, and Values, also helping 
                them to better prepare for the Microsoft and TOEIC certificates. 
                We hope this helpful tool will prosper forever for you, dear 
                friends.</p>

                <h1>Message from the AM Seniors to you:</h1>

                <p> During these three years that we have been together,
                    it has been one of the best experiences; we went through
                    different situations, both good and evil, because to graduate,
                    you have to be patient, intellectual, and persevering.
                    It was challenging for all of us to graduate because of the
                    amount of homework we were assigned both at school and in the
                    course; although we knew it was going to happen, we were determined
                    to face it because we knew it would be worth it.
                    Sometimes we indeed felt incompetent, discouraged, tired,
                    that we could not go on, and all kinds of negative feelings and thoughts,
                    but if we put our hand down, if we let that consume us, all the
                    effort we had made would not have been worth it, however, with
                    the help of our Supérate teachers and our Supérate classmates
                    we could make it, we encouraged each other, we helped each other,
                    we promised to graduate together. So it was; we made it, and
                    all our effort to get here was thanks to us. We leave this gift
                    to you future Supérate graduates. We know this will help you to
                    go the extra mile and achieve your goals. </p>
